            As a RawFoodMaker, I want to create raw food items so that I can provide fresh ingredients for our customers. Additionally, I want to check if the shipment is sufficient; if it's not, I want to send an alert message to notify the team to restock.

            As a Manufacturer, I want to receive shipments from the RawFoodMaker so that I can ensure we have the necessary raw ingredients. After receiving the shipment, I want to store the raw food properly to maintain its quality for production.
